                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions.
                While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as
                Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic
                language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables,
                dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery
                (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D
                graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
                <br>
                <br>
                JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the
                core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.
                 <h4>These include:</h4>
                <br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically
                creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D
                graphics and audio samples.
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as
                    Disqus or Facebook.
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and
                    applications.

                <p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>

                Java code can call JavaScript from any thread, including the JavaFX application thread. However, if the JavaScript
                engine in the browser is busy, then a call to JavaScript might stick for some time

                    <li>JAVA stands for Just Another Virtual Accelerator. It is a computer-based programming language that is used as a platform
                    in itself.</li>
                    <li>Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the
                    Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, though,
                    JavaScript is in no way related to the Java programming language</li>

          <article>
            <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name
            you give to the variable</p>
            <br>
            <code>let myVariable;</code><br>
            <br>

                A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate
                statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each
                statement. There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use semicolons. For more details, see Your Guide to
                Semicolons in JavaScript.
